# The Kinetic Dive Testbed
Kinetic dive is a "full dive" adjacent technology which leverages the vibratory myesthetic illusion to induce a feeling of motion in limbs.

Here you will find whatever code and documentation is required to get started with your very own full dive setup.
This guide will consist of two sections, one for the Unity project, and one for the Arduino-based hardware stack.

# The hardware side:

 2. [Arduino Uno/Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano) x1
 3. [Surface EMG Electrodes](https://bio-medical.com/covidien-kendall-disposable-surface-emg-ecg-ekg-electrodes-1-24mm-50pkg.html) x (as many as you'll need)
 4. Wires and... stuff? Look, if you don't have what you need, head on over to [Level2Kits.com](level2kits.herokuapp.com) for a starter  kit
 

## Setup:
First things first, you'll need to figure out what you want to do. This guide assumes you want to setup on the bicep & tripeps, but this guide will work anywhere you have easy access to.

Once you know where you want to attatch them, you'll want to place the emg boards such that one of the
